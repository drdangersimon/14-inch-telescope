This document is a user's guide to the 14-inch Celestron telescope and the accompanying suite of instruments housed at the Tony Fairall Teaching Observatory at the University of Cape Town. This is a modern telescope that is used for teaching and simple astronomy projects. This guide will 
help you to understand and use the telescope and highlights the operational procedures. Read this document
carefully to ensure the safe use of the telescope.\\

Previously known simply as the UCT Teaching Observatory, these facilities were dedicated to Professor A.P. (Tony) Fairall in 2013. Professor Fairall was a much respected astronomer and scientist, and was greatly revered for the passion and ease with which he brought astronomy to his students and the general public alike.\\

The observatory is located on the roof of the RW James building on UCT's Upper Campus. The GPS coordinates are $33 \,^{\circ}57'21.3''\mathrm{S}$ $18\,^{\circ}27'41.7''\mathrm{E}$ and the dome is approximately 120 meters above sea-level.\\

\textbf{Chapter 2} of this document describes all basic observing procedures, including the start-up and shut-down sequence,
the telescope control via dedicated software (\emph{The SkyX}), the CCD camera control via its dedicated
software (\emph{Maxim DL}), target acquisition and auto-guiding.\\

\textbf{Chapter 3} outlines a number of advanced observing procedures, including remote observing and details of 
instrument changes.\\

\textbf{Chapter 4} highlights general guidelines for photometry.\\

\textbf{Chapter 5} describes usage of the newly-comissioned spectrometer.\\

\chapter{Basic Observing Procedures}

\section{Start up procedures}

This chapter describes the basic observing procedures on the 14-inch UCT teaching telescope. 
Step-by-step instructions are given in this Section and
summarised in Section~\ref{checklists}.

\subsection{Connecting the laptop}

The first step is the connect the observatory laptop to the power socket and internet cable. Make
sure that the dome control USB and the telescope control USB cables are connected to the laptop.
Turn on all the power switches in the dome (on the East and North wall of the dome) and start the
(windows) laptop.

\begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{documentation_images/plugs_E.jpg}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{documentation_images/plugsN_2.jpg}
    \caption{\label{fig:plugs}Switching on the power plugs. The left image shows the East wall plugs, the
image on the right shows the North wall plugs.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dome and telescope cover}

A sheet currently covers the telescope and protects it against dust. You can remove the sheet at this point.
In order to avoid damage to the telescope mirror from anything falling down whilst opening the dome, 
it is important to \emph{first} open the dome (at present this requires a bit of elbow grease), after which 
you can remove the telescope cover.\\

\subsection{The pull test}
To be sure that none of the instruments attached to the telescope might fall off and get damaged during the observation, it is recommend that you do a quick `pull test': Hold on firmly to the CCD imager or spectrograph at the back of the instrument stack and give a firm tug (in the direction away from the telescope) to check that it is fastened securely.

\subsection{Unlocking the RA and DEC drives}

When the telescope is parked during the day, both the Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (DEC) drives are 
in a `locked' position, ensuring the telescope does not move when there is no power to the telescope.\\

At this stage of your observing session, you now need to put the RA and the DEC drive from a 'locked' position
to a `star' position. This enables the telescope drive to be controlled from the laptop. 
Notice that when the drive clamps are in the mid position (marked by a `balance' sign), the telescope 
can move freely. Be careful to gently hold/support the telescope when you switch the drives from 
lock to star position!

\begin{figure}[ht]
 \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{documentation_images/drive_Dec}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{documentation_images/drive_RA}
    \caption{\label{fig:drives}Left: Declination drive, right: Right Ascension drive.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Telescope control: \emph{The SkyX}}
\label{telescope_control}

\emph{The SkyX} is an all inclusive astronomy program that gives you the power of the 
universe at the point of a mouse. It should be able to guide the telescope, control the CCD, 
focus the image, control the dome and control the rotator. 
Unfortunately, it has some bugs so all it can really control at the moment the telescope, the 
dome rotation and the CCD rotator. To access the user manual for \emph{The SkyX}, 
visit \url{http://www.bisque.com/help/TheSkyXSAEAndPro/index.htm}.\\

On the laptop you can start \emph{The SkyX}. This program controls the telescope, the dome and the
rotator (on which the CCD is mounted).\\

You will see a big X symbol on the laptop for 'The SkyX Professional Edition'. Double click this
system to start \emph{The SkyX}. You can minimize the window during the observations if you need to 
toggle between telescope control and CCD control. You can reopen the window by clicking on the 'X' 
on the bottom bar.\\

During the start up procedure you need to \textit{connect} and \textit{Find Home} for the dome, 
the telescope and the rotator. To connect the telescope, click on the \textbf{Telescope} bar on the left-vertical menu, and 
under the \textbf{Start Up} pull-down menu, select \textbf{Connect}. The program will then request 
a \textit{Find Home} procedure, which will initialise the telescope.\\

%\clearpage

Before you enable the \textit{Find Home} procedure, make sure to remove any chairs or other obstacles that might be in the
way of the telescope as it moves. Confirming the \textit{Find Home} command will move the telescope 
to its start-up position. The status should read: {\textcolor{PineGreen}{\tt Tracking at sidereal rate}}.
The display of \emph{The SkyX}, \textit{connecting} the telescope is shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:connect_telescope}.\\

\begin{figure}[ht]
 \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{documentation_images/connect_telescope.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:connect_telescope}Shows how to connect the computer to the telescope.}
\end{figure}

Next, to connect the dome, click on the \textbf{Dome} bar on the left-vertical menu and press 
\textbf{Connect}. The status of the dome should now read: \textcolor{PineGreen}{\tt Connected}.
To connect the rotator, click on the \textbf{Rotator} bar on the left-vertical menu and 
click \textbf{Connect}. Repeat this if \emph{The SkyX} complains.  The status of the Rotator should 
read: \textcolor{PineGreen}{\tt Ready}. The telescope is now ready for use.\\

\begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{documentation_images/dome_control.jpg}
    \caption{\label{fig:dome_control}Manual override lever for the dome.}
\end{figure}

The motor that controls the Dome's rotation is slightly more powerful than neccesary, so the dome may occasionaly overshoot in such a way as to block the telescope's view. To rotate the dome back into place, the lever seen in Figure~\ref{fig:dome_control} was installed on the East wall of the room. Pushing the lever to the left (FOR) will move the Dome anit-clockwise and to the right (REV), clockwise. Use this lever when you see that the dome-opening is not aligned with the telescope's pointing and needs adjustment.\\


\subsection{CCD control: \emph{Maxim DL}}

On the laptop you can start \emph{Maxim DL}. Double click on the symbol for 'Maxim DL Pro 5'. 
Minimisation of the window is the same as for \emph{The SkyX}.\\

To enable CCD camera control from the laptop, click on the \textit{Toggle Camera Control (CTRL + W)} button.
This button is located in the second row of the menu bar and looks like a `button with two wires'. 
This will open a new window (entitled \emph{Camera Control}, see Figure~\ref{fig:coolers}).  
In this window, click \textbf{Connect}.\\

A new window is launched (entitled \emph{SBIG AO Control}). On the `Camera Control' window, click on
coolers \textbf{On}. This will cool the CCD-chip in the camera. You will notice that the temperature for 
Camera 1 (the normal CCD) will drop to $-5 \,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (a preset temperature that depends on the outside 
temperature).\\

\begin{figure}[ht]
 \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{documentation_images/maximdl_cooler}
    \caption{\label{fig:coolers}The camera control window on \emph{Maxim DL}.}
\end{figure}

Once the sensor temperature is down to the setpoint temperature, the CCD camera is ready for use. 
The cooling power should be around 60-70\%. If it is persistently above 70\%, change the setpoint 
temperature to a higher value (in steps of $5 \,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$) through the `Setup' button.\\

The entire system is now ready for on-sky observations, align the pointing and setting the focus of the telescope. From there you can acquire your science target and set up the auto-guiding using the 'Adaptive Optics' module (Camera 2 in \emph{Maxim DL}). This process is described in the following two sections.

\section{Acquiring a target}
\label{acquire}

% \begin{figure}[h]
% \centering
%    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{documentation_images/basic_interface.png}
%    \caption{\label{fig:basic_interface} This is how \emph{The SkyX} looks like when it is open.}
% \end{figure}

\subsection{Aligning the pointing of the telescope}
\label{pointing}

%\subsection{Small Changes to Pointing}
%\label{small_changes_to_pointing}

If the telescope and the \emph{The SkyX}'s pointing are not precisely aligned, follow these steps to correct it. 

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Find and slew to field you would like to look at.

 \begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{documentation_images/moving_telescope.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:moving_telescope}Click the green slew button to start the telescope's movement.}
\end{figure}

 \item \label{2} Take an image with your favorite CCD manager, \emph{Maxim DL} for instance, and save the resulting .FITS file. (Note: For an astrometric solution like we are about to attempt, \emph{The SkyX} recommends using an image that contains at least eight distinct stars, so try to aim for a well-populated field).

 \item In \emph{The SkyX}, under the menu \emph{Tools -- Image Link} (Ctrl+Shift+I), in the \emph{Search} tab, click the \textbf{Open FITS...} window.

  \begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{documentation_images/tools_menu_1_1.png}
    \caption{ \label{fig:tools_menu}Click on \emph{Tools -- Image Link...} to access the image linking window.}
  \end{figure}

 \item Load in your saved test field from Step \ref{2} and then click the \textbf{Find Astrometric Solution} button. \emph{The SkyX} will now attempt to find the exact location of your photo on the sky. 

 \item If the solution fails, check that the binning and Image Scale of your loaded image is set correctly. They should be (for $x \times x$ binnnig):

 \begin{itemize}
  \item $1\times1 = 0.72$ arcseconds
  \item $2\times2 = 1.44$ arcseconds
  \item $3\times3 = 2.15$ arcseconds
  \item $4\times4 = 2.88$ arcseconds 
 \end{itemize}

 \item If you managed to obtain a successful solution , go to the \emph{FOVI Options} tab and click the \textbf{Synchronize Rotator Angle to Position Angle} button.

  \begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{documentation_images/pointing2_1.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:pointing1}Click at arrow to access sync telescope pointing with image.}
  \end{figure}

 \item Exit the Image Link window and go back to the main screen.

 \item Click on the loaded image in the main window until the heading in the \emph{Find} tab shows `Linked Photo'. This is to make sure you haven't mistakenly selected a star or other sky object other than your loaded image.

 \item Now click on the \textbf{Sync} button on the tool-bar. If all went well the telescope and the software should be pointing in the same direction now. If you find that the pointing is still misaligned, you may need to repeat steps 1 to 8. Repeated failures may also mean that some of the \emph{Source Extractor} paramaters may need to be adjusted. For help with this, see the user's guide for \emph{the SkyX}.
\end{enumerate}

%\subsection{Rotator}
%\label{Correcting_rotation}

\emph{The SkyX} can control the rotation of the camera, but there is a bug in the software that causes the readings to be off, and this changes depending on where you are pointing in the sky. There is also no easy way to adjust the rotation of the CCD in \emph{The SkyX}.\\

\clearpage

The rotator is important for selecting a guide star for the Adaptive Optics (AO). The following steps tell you how to calibrate and align a guide star on the AO CCD.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Step 1
 \item Step 2
 \item Step 3
 \item Step 4
 \item Step 5: Get coffee, repeat.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Focussing the telescope}
\label{focussing}

%putting the 'cuss' in 'focussing'

From time to time the telescope will need to be refocussed. This is especially true when changing between instruments (since the focus points of these instruments are located at different distances from the back of the telescope), but may even be neccesary when changing to a different filter. This section will describe how to find the optimal focus.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Start by slewing to a field that has at least one star (that is not too bright, but also not too dim; idealy between magnitudes 7.5 - 9), which you can can use to focus on.
 \item In the `Camera' window in \emph{Maxim DL}, select the \textbf{Focus Tools} tab. 
 \item Deselct the options for taking dark and subframes and automatically saving focus photos; and select the option to `Take Photo Continously'. Make sure you'll be taking `Light' frames by selecting the correct option from the drop-down menu.
 \item Set an appropriate exposure time (somewhere between 3 and 5 seconds will usually work) and press the \textbf{Continous Photos} button.

 \begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{documentation_images/focus_knob.jpg}
    \caption{\label{fig:focus_knob}The focus knob at the back of the telescope.}
 \end{figure}

 \item Depending on how out of focus the telescope is, you should now (after the initial image is taken) see an image with blurry dots or faint `donuts' which are very out of focus stars.
 \item Now you need to adjust the telescope's focus. Do this by turning the brass focussing knob at the back of the telescope (seen in Figure~\ref{fig:focus_knob}) in small increments either clockwise or anti-clockwise.
 \item If the focus gets better the stars in the continously-updating image should get sharper. If they don't, try turning the focusing knob in the other direction. 
 \item Continue this process untill the stars in your focussing image is as sharp as possible.
 \item For precise photometric measurements, you may want additional reassurance that the telescope is in focus. Clicking on the \textbf{Graphs} button will bring up a plot of x and y pixel positions on the CCD versus brightness. The better the focus, the narrower and the higher the brightness peak will be –- and the smaller the FWHM value of the peak. Adjust the focus until this the FWHM-value is as low as possible.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Selecting a guide star}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Step 1
 \item Step 2
 \item Step 3
 \item Step 4
 \item Step 5: Got it!

\subsection{Calibration Images}
\label{calibration}

Depending on the circumstances, it may be neccesary to take a series of calibration images to correctly reduce your light frames. An existing library of calibration images exists on the {\tt darkstar} server at {\tt ftp://darkstar.ast.uct.ac.za/}. These may however not always be appropriate to correctly reduce your science images, and you may thus have to allow time during your observation to collect a new set. This section briefly describes the types of calibration images you may need, and how to take them.\\

Examples of typical calibaration images from the telescope and CCD imager are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cal}. These are hardly ever very interesting to look at, but makes a huge impact on the quality of your science images.\\

\paragraph{Bias Frames.}
  Bias frames are used to subtract the readout signal from the CCD itself, and amounts to basically a 0-second exposure. It is important that the bias frames are taken at the same CCD-temperature as the science frames you will be reducing them with. Bias frame exposures may be collected as part of a sequence of images while collecting light and dark images and are relatively straightforward to set up (see Section \ref{taking_images}). Between 10 and 20 bias frames are collected normally and then combined into a master bias frame later in the reduction pipeline.

\paragraph{Dark Frames.}
  Subtracting dark frames from your collected science images will correct for the accumulation of thermal, electronic and random noise on the CCD. The reason why the CCD is cooled is to reduce this noise as much as possible, but it can never be completely avoided. Dark frames account for this noise and is a time exposure (of the same duration as your light images) taken with the shutter closed. \emph{Maxim DL} and \emph{The SkyX} have built-in options to take dark frames either by themselves, or as part of a series.

\paragraph{Flat Fields.}
  Flat field images are taken to account for the large-scale variations in sensitivity accross the CCD, caused by things such as the dust-specs on the lens or the telescope and instrument optics. Obtaining good flat field images is not easy and is usually done by median-combining multiple light images of the twilight sky or an evenly lit section of the inside of the dome. The final product is then used to divide out the pixel to pixel sensitivity in the science images.\\

\section{Close down procedures}

The close down procedure is the inverse of the start up process.\\

% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item In your CCD-controller, click on `Disconnect Camera'
%  \item In \emph{Maxim DL}, under the `Telescope' tab, click on `Park'. The telescope will slew into its parking position and sidereal tracking will be turned off. Once again, make sure the room is cleared from any objects (or presons!) the telescope might bump into.
%  \item Next you may click on `Disconnect Telescope'
%  \item In 'Dome' tab, click on `Park Dome'. Then, once the dome has come to a standstill in it's parking position, click on `Disconnect'.
%  \item You may now close the software, shut down the laptop and switch off all the wall plugs on the North and East walls
%  \item Set the RA and DEC drives on the telescope mount to their locked positions.
%  \item Replace the telscope's front cover and covering sheet.
%  \item Lastly, close the dome and make sure to set the closing latch in place.
% \end{enumerate}

\subsection{CCD control: \emph{Maxim DL}}

On the camera control window (\emph{Maxim DL}), click on `Warm Up' under `Coolers', and click `Disconnect' once camera 1
indicates that the cooler control is off.

\subsection{Telescope control: \emph{The SkyX}}

On \emph{The SkyX}, select the \textbf{Telescope} tab. Under the `Shut Down' pull-down menu, select \textbf{Park}, to 
slew the telescope to the park position (status should be green and read \textcolor{PineGreen}{\tt Parked}). 
Then select the \textbf{Dome} tab and select \textbf{Park Dome} to move the dome to the park position. Then select \textbf{Disconnect} (status should change to red and read \textcolor{BrickRed}{\tt Not Connected}).\\

Select the `Rotator' tab and select \textbf{Disconnect} (status should change to red and read \textcolor{BrickRed}{\tt Not Connected}).
Finally, under `Telescope', and the `Shut Down' menu, select \textbf{Disconnect} to disconnect the telescope (status
should change to red and read \textcolor{BrickRed}{\tt Not Connected}). The telescope is now parked.

\subsection{Locking the RA and DEC drives}

Change the RA and DEC drive clamps from the `star' position to the `locked' positions. 
Notice that the telescope will move a bit even when it is in the `locked' position. Move the
telescope until it physically locks into the `locked' position.

\subsection{Pull test and covers}
Recheck that the CCD is attached with a quick pull test. When you are satisfied that the instruments are safe, replace the telescope's front cover and covering sheet. Ensure that the front cover sits in place properly and that the sheet is draped so as to cover both the telescope and the instrument stack.

\subsection{Disconnect power}

Save any unsaved open files on the laptop on the harddrive or server, close any open applications, then shut down the laptop and close the lid. After that you may switch off all the wall plugs on North and East walls of the room.

\subsection{Close the dome}

Finally, you'll need to once again apply some elbow grease to close the dome. With the shutters closed, flip over the locking latch (Figure~\ref{fig:latch}) on the bottom of the left shutter to ensure that the dome stays closed. The observatory is now shut down and you are ready to leave. Before leaving, make doubly sure to have the keys to the observatory \emph{in you hand!} It is deceptively easy to lock the keys inside the room.\\

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{documentation_images/domelatch.jpg}
    \caption{\label{fig:latch}Latch in place to keep the dome securely closed}
\end{figure}

%\clearpage

\section{In the event of a power failure}

Should the power go off during an observation session, the uninterrupted power supply (UPS) will continue to supply power to the telescope, laptop and instruments until it has no more battery life left.\\

If the power remains off for more than a couple of minutes, it may be a good idea to call it a night and get some well-deserved sleep. Follow the close down procedures as described earlier to shut down the telescope and the dome safely before you leave.\\

\clearpage

\section{Important phone numbers and observer safety}

It's is very important, no matter how absorped you might be in the night sky, to always be vigilant and safe. Try to always observe in groups rather than alone -- an extra pair of eyes is always a good idea, plus you'll have someone to take over the frequent coffee-making duties (if you ask nicely).\\ 

For technical troubles or difficulties with the software, telescope or dome, the first person to contact is Thuso Simon on \textbf{073 535 2201}. For any non-urgent queries you may also email him at {\tt thuso.simon@gmail.com}.\\

% Photometry
%--------------------------------

\chapter{Photometry}

Photometry is concerend with measuring the brightness of an object. Whether that object be a star, a planet, an asteroid or a galaxy, photometric measurements can give a valuable insight into it's behaviour and characteristics. Doing photometry on a time-series can in addition give you information on how these properties change over time or reveal details about the object's environment.\\



\section{Getting WCS coordinates in your image}

There are several bits of information neccesary to do accurate photometric measurements, some of which can be written as metadata into the header of the {\tt .FITS} files (images) you will take. Among these are things like the filter used and exposure time, but, very importantly, you will also need the correct WCS (world coordinate systems) coordinates. From the WCS coordinates it is possible to not only to corrctly identify your object, but also compute the \emph{airmass} -- the optical path length through the atmosphere through which your object is observed. The airmass information will be used when doing magnitude calculations later.\\

\subsection{With \emph{MaximDL}}
When taking an image with \emph{MaximDL}, the software already writes approximate RA and DEC values to the {\tt .FITS} header. \emph{Maxim DL} has built-in functionality to perform more accurate astrometry on an image you take, and if the astrometric analysis is succesful, add WCS coordinates to the {\tt .FITS} file header. To access this tool, which uses the PinPoint astrometric engine, go to \emph{Analyse –- PinPoint Astrometry}. The various settings should already be set up correctly and the image parameters pulled in from the existing {\tt .FITS} header. Click on \textbf{Process} to begin solving your image.\\

\subsection{With {\tt astrometry.net}}
Should your solve be unsuccessful and fiddling with the setting not get you anywhere, you may want to try uploading your {\tt .FITS} image to {\tt http://astrometry.net/}. This is a fantastic free tool that can solve some very tricky images and provide you with a host of information about your image. Note that if {\tt http://astrometry.net/} solves your image and provides you with astrometric data, you will manually need to add the data back to the {\tt .FITS} header of your image(s) using a suitable {\tt .FITS} header editor.\\

See Section~\ref{autoapi} on the automatic reduction API to see how to automatically upload and solve your images as part of the image reduction pipeline.

\subsection{With \emph{The SkyX}}
Using the \emph{Image Link} functionality in \emph{The SkyX}, as described in section \ref{pointing} will also get you correct WCS coordinates. After linking an image successfully, the \emph{`Astrometry'} and \emph{`Cursor Information'} windows will give you detailed information about the objects in the image, including precise position. The {\tt .FITS} header will in this case have to be updated manually too.\\

The \emph{`Cursor Information'} window also gives you the \textbf{scale} of your image. If you failed to find an astrometric solution in \emph{Maxim DL} earlier, it could have been that the image scale was set wrongly and you might now want to use this information to try again.



\section{Standard Stars and Calibration}

One of the most important steps in doing accurate CCD photometry is calibrating, or reducing, your image properly. For this you would need the usual set of \textbf{bias, dark} and \textbf{flat field} images (see Section~\ref{calibration}), to correct for any unwanted noise. Suitable calibration images matching the current imaging conditions and parameters (CCD temperature, exposure time, filter used, etc) might already be stored in the calibration image library on the {\tt darkstar} server. If not, you would need to allow time during your observation run to collect these too.\\

When doing differential photometry, you will need calibrated data on the standard or reference stars in your FOV (or as close by in the sky as possible). The Variable Star Plotter (VSP) is a tool to generate a plot of reference stars from the latest data in the Variable Star Index. The VSP is available at {\tt http://www.aavso.org/standard-stars-vsp}.



\section{Aperture photometry}

Aperture photometry in it's simplest form, is a way to take photometric measurements from a point source, by adding up pixel counts in a circle centered on the object and subtracting the light due to the sky. \\

% \[S_b = (S_t + S_b) - S_t\]

Measurements for your target and the background sky can be taken simultaneously with a multiple aperture instrument, or, in the case of CCD detectors, by using software to select apertures for the target and the sky. Usually a round aperture is centered on the object, with a larger annular ring just outside to measure the sky. An additional `gap' may also be specified through which you can select any object to specifically exclude from your measurements. An example of such a setup is shown below in Figure~\ref{fig:annulus}. 

 \begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{documentation_images/annulus.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:annulus}Aperture, gap and annulus}
 \end{figure}

\section{The Point Spread Function}

Aperture photometry on crowded star fields, such as globular- or open clusters, will not generally give accurate results. In this case it is better to make use of a Point Spread Function -- a gaussian that can be fitted to all the stars in your field in order to find their magnitude.

%from wikipedia: "When doing photometry in a very crowded field, such as a globular cluster, where the profiles of stars overlap significantly, one must use de-convolution techniques, such as point spread function (PSF) fitting, to determine the individual fluxes of the overlapping sources.""

\section{Positioning an object on the slit}

When attempting to collect the spectrum of an object, it is first neccesary to point the telescope so that the object appears on the camera's tracking CCD. For the purposes of using the spectrograph, you can use \emph{The SkyX} to both position the telescope and control the CCD.\\

To correctly place an object to be analysed you should do the following:\\

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Slew to the object you would like to investigate.
 \item In the `Autoguider' tab on the left side of the screen, set up and take a short exposure and make sure the object you selected appears on the resulting image. Adjust the telescope's pointing if needed. (Note: There's no need to save this, or any of the autoguiding images)
 \item Flip the swith on the bottom of the spectrograph (Figure~\ref{fig:internal_LED}, to turn on the internal LED. The LED backlights the slit, which allows you to see it clearly when positioning your object.

 \begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{documentation_images/internal_LED.jpg}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{documentation_images/internal_LED.jpg}
    \caption{\label{fig:internal_LED}LED swithch on the spectrograph and the slit visible on the autoguide image. (R-image to be swopped out)}
 \end{figure}

 \item Still inside the `Autoguiding' tab, set up a continous series of exposures, similar to the way you would when focusing the telescope (see section \ref{focussing}) then adjust the telescope so that your object falls right on the slit. You can adjust the telescope either with the hand-controller or with the green Up/Down/Left/Right arrows in the `Telescope' tab.

 \item If your object is a star, it is positioned correctly when it slightly stradles the slit. For extended objects, have the slit cut through the section you would like to take spectra from. Once you are satisfied with your alignment you may `Abort' the continuous exposures.\\

\end{enumerate}

Note that a bright star right on the slit might cause multiple images to appear, dislaced horzontally. It should still be quite clear which one is the brightest, and therefore the actual star. If you are unsure, broaden the dynamic range of the displayed image until it is clear which object is the brightest.


\section{Set up autoguiding}

To keep your object positioned on the slit as accurately as possible, you now need to activate the autoguiding feature.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item In the `Autoguide' tab, collect a new image (or if your last image is only a few seconds old, use that one)

  \begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    %\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{documentation_images/internal_LED.jpg}
    %\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{documentation_images/internal_LED.jpg}
    \caption{\label{fig:autoguide}The `Autoguide' section in The SkyX}
 \end{figure}

 \item click
 \item click
 \item click
 \item `Autoguiding'

\end{enumerate}


\section{Taking spectra}

You are now ready to collect spectra of your chosen object.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Switch to the `Camera' tab.
 \item Set up series
 \item Expose
 \item done
\end{enumerate}

\section{Standard Spectrographic Stars for Calibration}

To do a detailed study spectrographic data of the object you are investigating, it is neccesary to compare it against stars whose spectral characteristics are known. You will therefore need to also collect spectra from a standard spectropgraphic star during the same observation run. Idealy, this star would be located such that you will view it through the same airmass as the star or object you are investigating.\\

\textbf{A0} (or early A-type) and \textbf{B5} (or late B-type) stars have absorption-line characteristics that make them suitable calibration targets. Search the Simbad catalogue at \\ {\tt http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/} for a suitable star in the right part of the sky and collect data for that star like you would for your science target. During the reduction process later, you will apply corrections to the data you collected of the calibration target so that it matches the star's known characteristics. You will then apply those same corrections to the data for the object you are observing. If done successfully, your data will then be both calibrated for wavelength and flux, and you can start investigating the properties of your science target.

\subsection{Installing in Ubuntu/Linux}
The Ubuntu repository comes with ImageJ and we will use the configuration files from it to install AstroImageJ. 
\begin{itemize}
 \item download the latest version of AstroImageJ from the website. Make sure you get the version of Linux which should have a name like: \\ AstroImageJ\textunderscore Version\textunderscore BuildDate\textunderscore linux.tar.gz
 
\end{itemize}

First off, .
Untar the file with the following command: \$tar xf AstroImageJ\textunderscore Version\textunderscore BuildDate\textunderscore linux.tar.gz
You should now have a folder called AstroImageJ in your current directory.
Now install ImageJ using the Ubuntu repository: \$sudo apt-get install imagej
Once the installation is finished, ImageJ should be located under /usr/share/imagej. If it is not use the find command to find it: \$find /usr -name imagej
Copy all the AstroImageJ files from the untar directory to the imagej directory with a command like: \$sudo cp -r AstroImageJ/*  /usr/share/imagej/
Now when you type the command \$imagej you should get the AstroImageJ user interface.

\chapter{Remote observing}

\subsection{Remote access and Weather considerations}
\label{remote_obs}

Sitting in the dome all night while the telescope integrates is generally not a good idea. 
The temperature differences between your body can cause differences in the seeing in the telescope. 
We have set up a way to access the telescope computer from a remote place, so that the disturbances 
of the telescope are kept to a minimum.\\

To get the remote control software, goto \url{http://www.teamviewer.com/en/} and install 
the software on your computer. To access the observatory computer use the address:\newline
{\tt telescope.ast.uct.ac.za} and password: {\tt bonjour}.\\

Make sure that in the observatory that the telescope wont run into anything 
as it move throughout the night. Sit back in your remote setting and regularly keep an eye 
on the weather conditions. \\

\subsection{Weather conditions}

Rain, high humidity and excessive wind can cause serious damage to the observatory, the telescope and other instruments. When observing remotely, regularly check on the conditions outside. Should it become increasingly windy, foggy or threatening to rain, it would be best to interrupt the current observation session, park and close the dome and shut down and park telescope.

\chapter{Advanced Observation Procedures}

\section{Instrument change}

An assortment of instruments are installed in an instrument stack at the back of the 14-inch Celestron telescope. This includes a rotator, focusser, an adaptive optics module, and a CCD camera. During the course of 2013 a Santa Barbara Instrument Group Self Guided Spectrograph (SBIG-SGS) was added to the suite of instruments at the Tony Fairall Teaching Observatory. This section will describe how to change between the CCD-imager and the spectrograph. While it is not a difficult or laborius process, sufficient care should still be taken when handling these instruments.\\

\subsection{Changing from the CCD-imager to the spectrograph}

Steps to take down the CCD-imager and install the spectrograph are described below.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item If the telescope and camera are connected to the laptop and any software, disconnect the camera, `park' the telescope, and set the RA and DEC drives to their `lock' positions.
 \item Unplug the power, USB and telescope connection plugs from the camera.
 \item On the focusser (the bigger, black disk-like instrument), locate the 4 hex key holes. These are on the outside circumfrence of the fatter of the two disks.
 \item While supporting the imager, use a $\frac{5}{64}$ hex key to loosen the four bolts. Figure~\ref{fig:change_inst1} They only need to bee loosened and need be not removed completely.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{documentation_images/change_inst1.jpg}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{documentation_images/change_inst2.jpg}
    \caption{\label{fig:change_inst1} The instrument stack with imager, and the location of a bolt on the focusser.}
 \end{figure}

 \item When three or all of the bolts are sufficiently loose, the imager should come away from the focusser without any effort.
 \item In the black adaptive optics module attached to the imager, you will see a round lens. This is a focal reducer. Note the focal reducer's orientation, with the \emph{convex} side of the lens pointing \emph{out} as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:change_inst3}.

 \begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{documentation_images/change_inst3.jpg}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{documentation_images/change_inst4.jpg}
    \caption{\label{fig:change_inst3} Focal reducer -- note the convex side pointing out.}
 \end{figure}

 \item Set the imager aside out of harm's way, gently lift out the focal reducer from the AO-module and place it in the receptive nosepiece of the spectrograph. Again, make sure you put it in the right way around.
 \item You can now attach the spectrograph to the instrument stack -- keeping the nosepiece flush with the side of the focusser, tighten the four bolts on the focusser.
 \item Perform a `pull test' to doublecheck that everything is tightened sufficiently.
 \item You can now plug in the power, USB and telescope control plugs into the camera at the back of the spectrograph. These plugs are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:change_inst5}
 \item Lastly, you may need to rebalance the telescope to ensure it moves properly. Put the DEC drive on `balance' mode and swing the telescope so that it and the weight bar lie horisontally. Then, adjust the innermost weight until the the telescope can remain perfectly still without any assistance. The spectrograph is now installed and ready to analyse some starlight!

    \caption{\label{fig:change_inst5} Spectrogaph installed on the telescope, and the spectrographs's plugs.}
 \end{figure}

\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Changing from the spectrograph to the CCD-imager}

The procedure for taking down the spectrograph and installing the CCD camera is almost exactly the same as for the other way round, only this time you end with a camera attached to the telescope (surprise!). As before, take care with the focal reducer and perform a `pull test' when you're done to make sure everything is sturdy.
